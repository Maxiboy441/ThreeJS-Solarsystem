# ThreeJS-Solarsystem

**What is this project**

The project is a solar system with scaled planet sizes and distances from the sun, as well as revolutions and orbital periods. However, the scale for the distance to the sun is different from the scale of the planets, and the sun is also significantly smaller than the scale. This is for the simple reason that otherwise the model would not be viewable, for the solar system is unimaginably large.
